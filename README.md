# TweetDashboard
This project (other than the Express server) was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.17.

## Installation
1) Install all dependencies with `npm install`.

2) Go to [Twitter Apps page](https://apps.twitter.com/) and create a dev account and basic app. You will need consumer and access_token keys and secrets.

3) Replace the placeholders in `server.js` with your actual keys and secrets. Note: This is not a good long-term solution. You may want to set these as environment variables. Make sure to never commit code containing your actual keys and secrets.

## Development server
Run `npm run serve-build` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Further help
To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
